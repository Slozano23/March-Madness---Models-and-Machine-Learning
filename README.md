# March-Madness---Models-and-Machine-Learning
## Classification and Regression Using March Madness Data


These Projects were completed for a Data course labeled Models and Machine Learning. Semester-long projects were assigned and completed in groups; my group consisted of two peers: Jackson Garro and Cody Timarong.
Classification and regression were applied to two projects throughout the semester, and a presentation was delivered summarizing our findings.

The SSRD project was for a presentation of Student Scholarship where we used what we had learned in class in order to have more freedom and discover our own fidnings on our own terms.
